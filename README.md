# wavegen, a javascript wavetable generator
I did not create the base for the tool - it has been hosted on an old fc2 website. I cleaned it up (with the help of DEFENSE MECHANISM) and reposted it on its own, hoping to add more features (One has been added thus far, waveform clipping)

# Roadmap:
- [x] Implement clipping for all output modes (currently it's available for everything sans float).
- [x] Implement a distortion selector (off/clip/fold/wrap/absolute checkmark).
- [x] Refactor the code so that the wavetable generation only needs to happen once, with the output being transformed afterwards (will be done as part of above, hopefully).
- [x] Fix the broken distortion modes (Wrap is fixed).
- [ ] Clean up the help-page even more to add a more comprehensive breakdown of how the program works.
- [x] Add comments to the code as needed.
- [x] Get rid of help page, embed it as part of the main page.
- [ ] Make the help page look nicer.
- [ ] (might be unfeasible) replace graph view with an actual graph view that's easier to look at.
