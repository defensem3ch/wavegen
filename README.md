# wavegen, a javascript wavetable generator
I did not create the base for the tool - it has been hosted on an old fc2 website. I cleaned it up (with the help of DEFENSE MECHANISM) and reposted it on its own, hoping to add more features (One has been added thus far, waveform clipping)

# Roadmap:
- [x] Implement clipping for all output modes (currently it's available for everything sans float)
- [x] Implement a distortion selector (off/clip/fold/wrap)
- [x] Refactor the code so that the wavetable generation only needs to happen once, with the output being transformed afterwards (will be done as part of above, hopefully)
- [ ] fix the broken distortion modes lol
- [ ] Clean up the help-page even more to add a more comprehensive breakdown of how the program works
- [ ] Add comments to the code as needed.
